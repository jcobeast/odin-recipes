      <strong><em>Maja blanca</em></strong> is a Filipino dessert that has a
      gelatin-like consistency made with coconut milk and topped with latik
      (browned coconut cream curds).
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
      <li>2 (14-ounce cans) unsweetened coconut cream</li>
      <li>3/4 cup canned cream-style corn</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        To make the latik: Bring coconut milk to a boil in a large nonstick
        skillet over high heat. Continue to boil, stirring occasionally, until
        oil begins to separate from the milk, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium. Continue to cook, scraping the bottom of the
        skillet regularly with a heatproof spatula until only golden brown
        residue and oil is left, about 15 minutes. It will look a bit like
        ground meat, this is normal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain mixture to separate coconut solids from the oil. The coconut
        solids are the latik and will be served with the pudding. Reserve the
        oil for another use. Cover and chill the latik until serving time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper, extending the
        paper up two sides of the pan. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the pudding: Whisk sugar and cornstarch together in a medium
        saucepan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in coconut cream, cream-style corn, and corn kernels, if using.
        Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly, about 5 minutes.
        Reduce heat to medium. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is thick
        and bubbly, 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour corn mixture into the prepared pan. Cover and refrigerate until
        chilled, at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours before serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Invert pudding carefully onto a serving plate. Remove parchment and
        discard. Cut into 12 slices. Remove latik from the refrigerator. Chop
        finely, if desired. Sprinkle latik over each slice.
      </li>
    </ol>
