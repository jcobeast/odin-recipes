    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Arroz caldo is a comforting and flavorsome Filipino rice and chicken soup
      served mainly as a snack but can be enjoyed any time of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arroz caldo is a lugaw (glutinous rice dish) made with chicken and rice.
      It’s flavored with garlic, onions, ginger, fish sauce, and other
      seasonings.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 ¼ pounds chicken wings, split and tips discarded</li>
      <li>5 ¼ cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 cup glutinous sweet rice</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, garlic,
        and ginger in hot oil until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add chicken
        wings; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in fish sauce, cover, and cook
        another 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour chicken broth into the pot. Stir in sweet rice and bring mixture to
        a boil. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent
        rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Season with salt and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Portion soup into bowls and garnish with green onion. Serve with lemon
        slices and additional fish sauce, if desired.
      </li>
      <li>Season and continue cooking until the chicken is fully cooked.</li>
    </ol>
