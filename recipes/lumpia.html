    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a traditional Filipino recipe for lumpia, or fried spring rolls.
      They're made with paper-thin lumpia wrappers and filled with a savory
      mixture of ground pork, cabbage, and other vegetables. Serve lumpia as a
      side dish or appetizer with a sweet chili dipping sauce.

      Lumpia are fried spring rolls that are found in Filipino and Indonesian
      cuisines. The rolls traditionally feature a thin pastry skin (a.k.a. a
      lumpia wrapper) and are often stuffed with a savory mixture of ground pork
      and vegetables.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high
        heat. Add pork; cook and stir until crumbly and no longer pink, 5 to 7
        minutes. Remove pork from the pan and set aside. Drain grease from the
        pan, leaving just a thin coating.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onion and garlic to the pan; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in cooked pork, carrots, green onions, cabbage, and cilantro.
        Season with pepper, salt, garlic powder, and soy sauce. Remove from the
        heat, and set aside until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble lumpia: Place 3 heaping tablespoons of filling diagonally
        near one corner of a lumpia wrapper, leaving a 1 Â½ inch space at both
        ends.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold the side along the length of the filling over the filling, tuck in
        both ends, and roll neatly and tightly to close.
      </li>
      <li>
        Moisten the other side of the wrapper with water to seal the edge.
        Transfer to a plate and cover with plastic wrap to retain moisture.
        Repeat to assemble remaining lumpia.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat for 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slide 3 to 4 lumpia into the hot oil, making sure the seams are facing
        down. Fry, turning occasionally, until all sides are golden brown, 1 to
        2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat to fry
        remaining lumpia.
      </li>
      <li>Serve immediately. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
